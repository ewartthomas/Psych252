## Load in the data

W're using data from the [Economics Web Institute](http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/data/wagesmicrodata.xls), which has info about wage, years of education, and sex.
```{r}
w = read.csv('http://stanford.edu/class/psych252/data/wagesmicrodata.csv')
str(w)
```

## Set our contrasts

```{r}
contrasts(w$sex) = cbind(Cfemale = c(1, 0))
contrasts(w$sex)
```

## Run the model

```{r}
res = lm(wage ~ education + sex, data=w)
summary(res)

# head(model.matrix(res))
# head(w)
```

Here, our equation is: 
$$wage = \alpha{0} + \delta_0\text{Cfemale } + \alpha_1\text{education} + \epsilon$$.
Plugging in our coefficients we get: $wage = 0.22 + -2.12\text{Cfemale } + 0.75\text{education}$, where `Cfemale` = 1 when the person is a female, and 0 when male (thus, that effect goes to zero if we're trying to figure out the wage of a male).
In this case, our intercept is the mean wage when education = 0 for our baseline (male) group. The effect of education is controlling for sex, so regardless of sex, an increase in education leads to an increase in wage, $b=0.75, t(531)=9.78, p < 0.001$. Further, controlling for education, relative to the males, females have lower wages, $b=-2.12, t(531)=-5.27, p < 0.001$.

## Visualize the effects

```{r}
library(effects)
plot(allEffects(res))
```


## Scale our continuous variables, and reinterpret!

```{r}
res2 = lm(wage ~ scale(education, scale=FALSE) + sex, data=w)
summary(res2)
```
