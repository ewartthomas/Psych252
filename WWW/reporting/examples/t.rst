One-sample t tests, comparing standard scores in the current sample to the national average for the respective test, revealed that the mean PSAT Math score in the current sample was significantly higher than the national average for that year (t(32) = 2.75; p < 0.05), as was the PSAT Critical Reading mean score (t(32) =  2.32; p < 0.05).
