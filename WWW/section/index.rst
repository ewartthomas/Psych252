Template homework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This serves as template layout for completing the homework. Make sure to load in
relevant packages in the beginning of the document, and **knit often** while you're
completing the homework! This will help ensure that you're able to "knit" the
final html file!
